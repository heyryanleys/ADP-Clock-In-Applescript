# Clock in and out of ADP with Mac Apps & Keyboard Shortcuts

Currently in development, right now works as two applications that can be placed in the dock, or linked to keyboard shortcuts via Automator & System Preferences.  

When the app is opened it launches Safari to ADP login window, hides Safari, logs in to your ADP account (Username & Password must be saved in Safari), then clocks you in or out depending on the app you opened, and finally closes Safari and the app.

Currently working on a way to do this with Amazon Dash buttons
